# Introduction
When factoring heat generation required for the manufacturing and transportation of products, Greenhouse gas emissions attributable to products, from food to sneakers to appliances, make up more than 75% of global emissions.

Our data, which is publicly available on [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01178-9), contains product carbon footprints (PCFs) for various companies. PCFs are the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to a given product, measured in CO2 (carbon dioxide equivalent).
